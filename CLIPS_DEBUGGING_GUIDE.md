# üîç Clips Not Visible - Debugging Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Backend Server**: Running on port 8001  
‚úÖ **Frontend Server**: Running on port 3000  
‚úÖ **Database**: Contains completed jobs with clips data  
‚úÖ **Code Changes**: URL parameter support and clickable jobs implemented  

## The Problem
The "Generated Clips" section is not appearing despite having completed jobs with valid clip data.

## Most Likely Cause: Authentication Issue
The API requires authentication, and the frontend may not be properly authenticated or sending auth headers.

## üéØ Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check Authentication Status
1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Check if you're logged in (look for user info in top-right)
3. If not logged in:
   - Click "LOGIN" 
   - Use: `merlino874@gmail.com` (this user has completed jobs)
   - If you don't know the password, create a new account

### Step 2: Test Direct Job URL
1. Open browser dev tools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/video?job=7f3ef31c-634d-49ff-9ea6-d649ce9cdc35`
3. Look for debug logs starting with: `üîç JobProgress Debug:`
4. Check what data is being received

### Step 3: Check Network Requests
1. In dev tools, go to Network tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for API calls to `/api/v1/jobs/7f3ef31c-634d-49ff-9ea6-d649ce9cdc35`
4. Check if the request:
   - Has `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Returns 200 status (not 401 Unauthorized)
   - Contains `results` and `clips_by_platform` data

### Step 4: Check Console Errors
Look for any JavaScript errors in the console that might prevent rendering.

## üîß Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Clear Browser Storage
1. Open dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Storage
3. Click "Clear storage" ‚Üí "Clear site data"
4. Refresh and log in again

### Fix 2: Force Re-authentication
1. Log out completely
2. Clear browser cache/cookies
3. Log back in with `merlino874@gmail.com`

### Fix 3: Test Different Job URLs
Try these other completed jobs:
- `http://localhost:3000/video?job=8b08b817-0d7d-4ee2-a39a-475e9e0e94f7`
- `http://localhost:3000/video?job=3ba3011a-9429-4382-baa9-13966b2e72a6`
- `http://localhost:3000/video?job=bb6c67d9-db81-4b2e-8889-c80efff93f61`

## üìä Expected Debug Output
When working correctly, you should see in the console:
```
üîç JobProgress Debug: {
  jobId: "7f3ef31c-634d-49ff-9ea6-d649ce9cdc35",
  currentJob: { ... },
  status: "COMPLETED",
  hasResults: true,
  hasClipsByPlatform: true,
  hasAllClips: true,
  clipCount: 3
}
```

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Not authenticated" Error
**Cause**: No valid auth token  
**Fix**: Log out and log back in

### Issue 2: Debug shows `currentJob: null`
**Cause**: API call failed or job not found  
**Fix**: Check network tab for failed requests

### Issue 3: Debug shows `hasResults: false`
**Cause**: Job data missing results field  
**Fix**: This shouldn't happen with the test jobs - indicates API issue

### Issue 4: Debug shows `clipCount: 0`
**Cause**: Clips data structure issue  
**Fix**: Check if `clips_by_platform.all` exists in API response

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Follow the debugging steps above
2. Note what you see in the console logs
3. Check the Network tab for API request details
4. If still not working, the issue is likely authentication-related

## üìù Test Account Info
- **Email**: `merlino874@gmail.com` (User ID: 3)
- **Has**: 5 completed jobs with clips
- **Most Recent Job**: `7f3ef31c-634d-49ff-9ea6-d649ce9cdc35` (3 clips)
