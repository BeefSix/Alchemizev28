"""
Refactored FastAPI video upload endpoint.

This module defines a single route for handling video uploads.  It performs
basic file validation, streams the uploaded video to disk to avoid loading
large files into memory, creates a job record, and dispatches the
background processing task via Celery.  Replace the existing upload
endpoint in `app/api/v1/endpoints/video.py` with the implementation below.

Note: You will need to add `aiofiles` to your project dependencies (it is
included in the standard FastAPI installation) and ensure that
`app.workers.video_tasks.run_videoclip_upload_job` is available.
